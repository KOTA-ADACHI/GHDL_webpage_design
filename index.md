## Who are we?
Global hydrodynamics lab (PI: Dai Yamazaki) is in Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo .

## What is Global Hydrodynamics?
“Global Hydrodynamics” is the study of the dynamics of terrestrial waters  over the entire Earth.  

It focuses on the movement and storage of the surface and sub-surface waters at multiple temporal and special scales from local to global, including rivers, lakes, wetland, soil moisture, and groundwater. It also covers their interactions with related earth surface processes, such as precipitation, evaporation, coastal and ocean dynamics, biogeochemistry, climate change.  

We extensively use modelling, remote sensing, and data integration approaches to cover the entire global, while we also respect in-situ observations to determine important processes in global hydrodynamics and to ensure the robustness of the model conceptualization.  

In addition to natural hydrological cycle, we also assess the impact of the terrestrial water variability to the human well-beings (e.g. flood, water resources, ecosystem service), and try to understand the reactions of the society (i.e. water resources and hazard management) and their feedback to the global hydrodynamic system.
